The Washtenaw County Historical Society invites you to hear co-authors Susan Wineberg and Patrick McCauley share compelling stories and images from their recently released book "Historic Ann Arbor: An Architectural Guide."

					<strong>Museum Studies Presents: The Challenge of Building a National Museum</strong>
					<br>
					<p>This talk will explore the history and struggle to create the National Museum of African American History and Culture focusing on a variety of challenges including building on the Mall, conceptual frameworks, public expectations, and contextual terrain of race.  Mr. Bunch will explore the strategies used to successfully navigate these challenges and in doing so he will update the audience as to the current status and future projections for the Museum.  Ultimately, Mr. Bunch will explore how the National Museum will help the Smithsonian transition from a 19th century institution to a 21st century enterprise.</p>
