					<p>Welcome to the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA). One of the finest university art museums in the country, UMMA holds collections representing 150 years of art collecting at the University, while its dynamic schedule of special exhibitions and interpretative programs connects visitors with the rich artistic legacy of the past and today's avant-garde. In 2009, UMMA opened a landmark addition, named the Maxine and Stuart Frankel and the Frankel Family Wing for its lead benefactors, and a major restoration of its historic Beaux-Arts home, Alumni Memorial Hall. Thanks to this major transformation, UMMA not only more than doubled the space available for collections display, temporary exhibitions, programs and educational exploration, but also fulfilled the Museum’s mission to bridge visual art and contemporary culture, scholarship and accessibility, tradition and innovation. We look forward to your visit!</p>

					<p>The Kelsey Museum enthusiastically welcomes visitors to the William E. Upjohn Exhibit Wing. In this beautiful and spacious exhibition area we display about four times as much of our permanent collection as we were able to exhibit in the old building. The Kelsey's world-famous collection and interactive exhibits offer something for everyone, and the Museum has long been a favorite of scholars and schoolchildren alike.</p>

					</div>
					<p>The Michigan Firehouse Museum and Education Center's mission is to enhance the appreciation of firefighting history through engaging and informative exhibits, as well as teaching and promoting fire safety and prevention. Encompassing over 26,000 square feet, the Museum is an educational treasure trove that includes an original 1898 firehouse and modern, multilevel exhibit display area. Walking through the restored firehouse, visitors can view a fire engine steamer replete with horses, ready to go on their way to a fire. The large, modern addition offers 25 changing exhibits of antique fire trucks and early fire rigs, multiple displays of historic artifacts including tools, equipment, memorabilia and the largest collection of fire truck bells in the country. The Museum is located in Ypsilanti’s historic Depot Town, just east of the city of Ann Arbor and a few blocks north of Interstate 94 Exit 183. Other historic venues, restaurants and first class hotel accommodations are nearby.</p>

					<p>YAHM’s featured automotive stories are Chevrolet Corvair, Tucker, Hudson, Kaiser-Frazer, and General Motors Hydra-matic; all with Ypsilanti connections. Displays include Motor State which held patents on power convertible tops, the Ford Motor Company Generator Plant, and local car dealerships. As a thriving commercial and manufacturing hub, Ypsilanti had a significant influence on these pioneering companies and the men who built them. The Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum preserves an important era in American history. The museum also hosts the National Hudson Motor Car Company Museum.</p>
